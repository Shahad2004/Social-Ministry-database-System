# Social-Ministry-database-System
In this document, you will find a brief explanation about the new Social Ministry database system, which will be used mainly to store and retrieve information about beneficiaries, trainers, organizers, and head organizers. Each user's access permissions are outlined to demonstrate how the system implements privileges and restrictions, ensuring effective and secure data management. This documentation describes the functionalities and architecture of our database system, focusing on system requirements, design (GUI), implementation processes, and system architecture. It provides instructions for the software technologies used and outlines the procedures and access for specific users such as ministry organizers and heads. This report focuses on everything from the userâ€™s point of view and serves as a consistent reference for users.

#Security
Security is a crucial aspect of the system, with specific privileges granted to different user roles to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. Below is a summary of user roles and their respective privileges:
- Head Organizer: Has full access to view, insert, update, and delete records related to beneficiaries, organizers, programs, and courses.
- Organizer (e.g., Hassan Farsi): Can execute specific procedures to manage programs and courses and has selective access to relevant tables.
- Trainer (e.g., Jane Smith): Can update and view courses they are responsible for and view their schedules.
- Beneficiary (e.g., Khaled Mohammed): Can view their schedules and available courses.
#User Interface
- Flowchart and Data Movement Diagrams
The user interface includes various diagrams to illustrate data flow and interactions for different user roles:
- Beneficiary: Interacts with their schedule and course information.
- Trainer: Manages and views courses they are responsible for.
- Organizer: Manages programs, courses, and schedules.
- Head Organizer: Oversees all aspects of the database, ensuring data integrity and smooth operations.
#Interfaces Development
The user interface consists of several pages, each designed to facilitate specific tasks for the users:

- Home Page: Allows the head organizer to view and navigate to tables they have permission to edit.
- Organizer View Table: Displays records from the organizer table with options to edit, delete, or add records.
- Editing Record Page: Enables editing of selected record attributes.
- Deleting Record: Provides cautionary confirmation before deleting a record.
- Adding Record: Allows the addition of new records with options to save or cancel.
- Error Page: Displays error messages for actions that violate constraints, such as duplicate primary key entries.
